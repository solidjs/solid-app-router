# Solid App Router

> 0.3.x only works with Solid v1.3.5 or later.
> `useData` has been renamed to `useRouteData` and no longer takes arguments. Refer to documentation below.

Solid App Router is a universal router for SolidJS that combines paradigms of React Router and Ember Router. Routes can be defined both in the JSX and as a JSON object for file-system based routing and supports Nested Routing.

It supports all Solid's SSR methods and has Solid's Transitions baked in, so use freely with Suspense, Resources, and Lazy components. Solid App Router also allows you to define a Data function that loads in parallel of the Routes to allow automatic fetch-as-you-render that removes client side request waterfalls.

## Getting Started

```sh
> npm i solid-app-router
```

Install then wrap your application with the Router component:

```jsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { Router } from "solid-app-router";
import App from "./App";

render(
  () => (
    <Router>
      <App />
    </Router>
  ),
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```

## JSX Based

```jsx
import { lazy } from "solid-js";
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { Router, Routes, Route, Link } from "solid-app-router";

const Users = lazy(() => import("/pages/users.js"));
const User = lazy(() => import("/pages/users/[id].js"));
const UserHome = lazy(() => import("/pages/users/[id]/index.js"));
const UserSettings = lazy(() => import("/pages/users/[id]/settings.js"));
const UserNotFound = lazy(() => import("/pages/users/[id]/[...all].js"));
const Home = lazy(() => import("/pages/index.js"));
const NotFound = lazy(() => import("/pages/[...all].js"));

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Awesome Site</h1>
      <Link class="nav" href="/">
        Home
      </Link>
      <Link class="nav" href="/users">
        Users
      </Link>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/users" element={<Users />} />
        <Route path="/users/:id" element={<User />}>
          <Route path="/" element={<UserHome />} />
          <Route path="/settings" element={<UserSettings />} />
          <Route path="/*all" element={<UserNotFound />} />
        </Route>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/*all" element={<NotFound />} />
      </Routes>
    </>
  );
}

render(
  () => (
    <Router>
      <App />
    </Router>
  ),
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```

## Config Based

Great for filesystem based routing:

```jsx
import { lazy } from "solid-js";
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { Router, useRoutes, Link } from "solid-app-router";

const routes = [
  {
    path: "/users",
    component: lazy(() => import("/pages/users.js"))
  },
  {
    path: "/users/:id",
    component: lazy(() => import("/pages/users/[id].js")),
    children: [
      { path: "/", component: lazy(() => import("/pages/users/[id]/index.js")) },
      { path: "/settings", component: lazy(() => import("/pages/users/[id]/settings.js")) },
      { path: "/*all", component: lazy(() => import("/pages/users/[id]/[...all].js")) }
    ]
  },
  {
    path: "/",
    component: lazy(() => import("/pages/index.js"))
  },
  {
    path: "/*all",
    component: lazy(() => import("/pages/[...all].js"))
  }
];

function App() {
  const Routes = useRoutes(routes);
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Awesome Site</h1>
      <Link class="nav" href="/">
        Home
      </Link>
      <Link class="nav" href="/users">
        Users
      </Link>
      <Routes />
    </>
  );
}

render(
  () => (
    <Router>
      <App />
    </Router>
  ),
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```

## Creating Links

Solid App Router provides `<Link>` component to provides links in your application. By default all Routes and Links are relative to the parent that created them.

Solid App Router provides a `<NavLink>` component that applies the `active` class when the current route matches its path. It has an `end` prop to indicate if it is the end of the path.

Solid App Router also has a `<Navigate>` component useful for inlining redirects.

These Components all use `href` to define the path.

```jsx
<>
  <NavLink href="/" end>
    Home
  </NavLink>
  <NavLink href="/about">About</NavLink>
  <NavLink href="/other">Other</NavLink>
</>
```

There are a few special properties that can be applied to links to add additional behavior.

`noScroll` - This prevents default behavior of scrolling to top navigation.
`replace` - This will replace history instead of pushing it.
`state` - This will add the state to the browser history. It must be serializable.

If you have a same domain link that you want the router not to handle use `rel="external"`

## Router Primitives

Solid App Router provides a number of primitives that read off the Router and Route context.

### useParams

Retrieves an object containing the route path parameters as defined in the Route.

```js
const params = useParams();

// fetch user based on the id path parameter
const [user] = createResource(() => params.id, fetchUser);
```

### useNavigate

Retrieves method to do navigation. The method accepts a path to navigate to and an optional object with the following options:

- resolve (_boolean_, default `true`): resolve the path against the current route
- replace (_boolean_, default `false`): replace the history entry
- scroll (_boolean_, default `true`): scroll to top after navigation
- state (_any_, default `undefined`): pass custom state to `location.state`

__Note:__ The state is serialized using the [structured clone algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm) which does not support all object types.

```js
const navigate = useNavigate();

if (unauthorized) {
  navigate("/login", { replace: true });
}
```

### useLocation

Retrieves reactive `location` object useful for getting things like `pathname`

```js
const location = useLocation();

const pathname = createMemo(() => parsePath(location.pathname));
```

### useSearchParams

Retrieves a tuple containing a reactive object to read the current location's query parameters and a method to update them. The object is a proxy so you must access properties to subscribe to reactive updates. Note values will be strings and property names will retain their casing.

The setter method accepts an object whos entries will be merged into the current query string. Values `''`, `undefined` and `null` will remove the key from the resulting query string. Updates will behave just like a navigation and the setter accepts the same optional second parameter as `navigate` and auto-scrolling is disabled by default.

```js
const [searchParams, setSearchParams] = useSearchParams();

return (
  <div>
    <span>Page: {searchParams.page}</span>
    <button onClick={() => setSearchParams({ page: searchParams.page + 1 })}>Next Page</button>
  </div>
);
```

### useIsRouting

Retrieves signal that indicates whether the route is currently in a Transition. Useful for showing stale/pending state when the route resolution is Suspended during concurrent rendering.

```js
const isRouting = useIsRouting();

return (
  <div classList={{ "grey-out": isRouting() }}>
    <MyAwesomeConent />
  </div>
);
```

### useRouteData

Retrieves the return value from the data function.

> In previous versions you could use numbers to access parent data. This is no longer supported. Instead the data functions themselves receive the parent data that you can expose through the specific nested routes data.

```js
const user = useRouteData();

return <h1>{user().name}</h1>;
```

### useMatch

`useMatch` takes an accessor that returns the path and creates a Memo that returns match information if the current path matches the provided path. Useful for determining if a given path matches the current route.

```js
const match = useMatch(() => props.href);

return <div classList={{ active: Boolean(match()) }} />;
```

### useRoutes

Used to define routes via a config object instead of JSX. See `Config Based` above.

## Nested Routing

You can define long paths on your routes and they are handle independently. But with nested Routing we can automatically set up nested layouts. Need to share a header between pages, nest it as children. You can see examples above.

However, while `<Routes>` serve as the entry point for the navigation, for nested routes you need to indicate where the nested route should be inserted. You use the `<Outlet>` component to do that.

```jsx
import { Outlet, useRouteData } from "solid-app-router";

function User() {
  const user = useRouteData();
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{user()?.name}</h1>
      {/* Insert nested Route Here */}
      <Outlet />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Data Functions

Data functions are designed to load in parallel to your lazy loaded routes. They get bundled with your main bundle allowing your page code to be separated and loaded on demand in parallel. You can pass in the `data` prop to your Route definition.

```js
import { lazy } from "solid-js";
import { Route } from "solid-app-router";
import UserData from "./pages/users/[id].data.js";

const User = lazy(() => import("/pages/users/[id].js"));

// In the Route definition
<Route path="/users/:id" element={<User />} data={UserData} />;
```

```js
// pages/users/[id].data.js
import { createResource } from "solid-js";

function fetchUser(userId) {
  /* fetching logic */
}

export default function UserData({ params, location, navigate, data }) {
  const [user] = createResource(() => params.id, fetchUser);

  return user;
}
```

Data function should create reactive values and return synchronously so that they can be accessed in the case that the route loads before the data does.
